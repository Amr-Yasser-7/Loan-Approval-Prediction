# Loan Approval Prediction

This repository contains my machine learning project on **Loan Approval Prediction**.  
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict whether a loan application should be approved or not, based on applicant information such as income, loan amount, and credit history.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Problem**: Loan approvals are critical for both applicants and financial institutions. Incorrect approvals can lead to financial risk, while incorrect rejections can damage trust and customer relationships.  
- **Objective**: Use machine learning to predict loan approvals accurately and interpret the factors that influence the decision.  
- **Dataset**: Loan application dataset (contains applicant demographic and financial details).

## 🔍 Steps & Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Explored the dataset to understand patterns and detect missing values.  
   - Visualized distributions of key variables such as income, loan amount, and credit history.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Encoded categorical features.  
   - Balanced the dataset to avoid biased predictions.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Trained classification models using **Scikit-learn**.  
   - Evaluated models with accuracy and classification metrics.  

4. **Results & Insights**  
   - Achieved strong accuracy in predicting loan approval status.  
   - Identified **credit history**, **income**, and **loan amount** as key features influencing predictions.
